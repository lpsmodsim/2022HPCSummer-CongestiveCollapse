# Demonstration of Congestive Collapse in SST 

[Structural Simulation Toolkit](https://sst-simulator.org/) (SST) is a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) framework written in C++ and Python. Although SST has historically focused on simulation of High Performance Computing, the DES framework can be used in other scenarios. 

In this repo, [congestive collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion#Congestive_collapse) is modeled using SST. 


This demonstration of congestive collapse relies only on [SST-Core](https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-core)
